# B04 Analysis Spine

## Authority and outcome

Base revision: `b8eb6b4967d5655ed4e528ee9cb222690a424d57`
(`origin/main`). `PLAN_step3.md` is absent from both the working tree and
`origin/main`; it is not reconstructed. B03 is complete through integrated
ISSUE-0156. This batch follows the final-release specification and canonical
registry for ISSUE-0074, ISSUE-0098–ISSUE-0109 as applicable, ISSUE-0112,
ISSUE-0123, ISSUE-0157, ISSUE-0172 and ISSUE-0174.

The batch outcome is one local-first, point-in-time multi-asset analysis,
forecast, peer, benchmark and risk-profile contract. Shared schemas are frozen
before downstream consumers. Missing, stale, conflicted or unsupported
evidence remains explicit. Adjusted/total-return prices are required for
returns, risk gates remain authoritative and `execution_allowed=false`.

## Sequence

1. Review and record ISSUE-0098's existing ISSUE-0074 score and ISSUE-0083
   classification interfaces without overstating incomplete contracts.
2. Advance ISSUE-0098 through separate guarded readiness and implementation
   transitions.
3. Implement the smallest usable point-in-time peer-cohort and sector-adapter
   framework with deterministic fallback, support, exclusions, versioning,
   read-only UI lineage and tests.
4. Recompute the canonical graph after ISSUE-0098 integration and select the
   next dependency-valid B04 issue. Do not pull blocked downstream work
   forward.

## Active prerequisite

`IN_PROGRESS` review only ISSUE-0098→ISSUE-0074. The merged canonical score-v3
interface supplies typed asset-specific components, configured weights,
coverage/conflict handling, deterministic formula/source hashes and separated
score outputs. It does not yet supply ISSUE-0098's point-in-time peer membership,
effective sample size, robust statistics, hierarchical fallback, bootstrap
intervals or reusable peer stores. Record the edge as `partial_interface`;
leave ISSUE-0098 planned and ISSUE-0083 unresolved.

This step changes no product code, status, dependency list, acceptance
criterion, policy or authority. It requires the exact dependency-edge guard,
registry/status/document freshness, focused canonical-score and control tests,
supply-chain validation, diff hygiene and a zero-action GitHub projection.

The proposed 197-record registry has SHA-256
`ecc1b95ae86fcf89b21c8b67b3c64135dc1e597f5f6ec77826c8d3a11be37aa2`.
The live GitHub projection is the zero-action semantic plan
`f51ed48ed324a3d4fbe89da65cacb8285ebd5fb59bc222efe542f4c8f8cb7dec`.
